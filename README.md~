In this first milestone, you will write a project proposal that will capture the “who, what, why and how” of your project plus any challenges that you foresee along the way. Your proposal will include: a specific business case or personal objective, any intended outcomes, a description of the needs of the intended audience, a description of the dataset to be used, and any foreseeable challenges
In milestone two, you will acquire the dataset that supports your project proposal, import it into Tableau, and prepare the data for analysis.
In this module, you will continue to work through Milestone 3, your exploratory analysis and dashboard creation as outlined in the third week. You will then submit your deliverables for peer review.
In this final milestone, you will apply design elements from our design checklist. You have met the goals of the stakeholder’s and will complete your design to meet the needs of the audience. You will apply the cognitive and visual design concepts learned throughout this Specialization and create a visualization or data story that leaves a lasting impression with your audience.
